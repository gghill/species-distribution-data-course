# species-distribution-data-course
[Data course](https://www.transmittingscience.com/courses/ecology/obtaining-and-cleaning-species-occurrence-data-with-r/) in R offered by Transmitting Science

Goals:
1) Import species occurrence data from various sources into R (e.g. GBIF, iNaturalist, VertNet, EcoEngine, national / regional / continental atlases)

2) Join and arrange these data into a homogeneous dataset for analysis

3) Map and visually inspect the data for taxonomic and spatial errors and bias

4) Clean the data from detectable errors, using both non-automatic and automatic tools (e.g. ‘scrubr’, ‘CoordinateCleaner’)

5) Correct or minimize spatial biases with different tools (e.g. ‘spThin’, ‘humboldt.occ.rarefy’, ‘gridRecords’).
